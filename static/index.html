            <p>If you're reading this, that means you came to visit my masterpiece of a bio-page(<em>that's a joke). Seriously though, thank you dearly! I've been on this coding journey for almost three years and man has it been an adventure! I started as a musician and decided in </em>2020</em> that I was going to make the transition into tech, considering it was another one of my passions. My first introduction to computer science was in 2010, when I majored in Networking. A special branch in the I.T field. From there I gained knowledge on how to develop basic websites and that's when I knew that this was something I had to get into eventually. So fast-forward he we are and I am at the tailend of my coding Bootcamp which deals with Data Science and I couldn't be any happier. This is a true milestone for me.  Now my next goal is to find an employer who will take me in as one of their own, to be with a team of other ardently driven software engineers and together we can achieve many goals! </p>
