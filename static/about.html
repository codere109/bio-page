            <p>If you're reading this, that means you came to visit my masterpiece of a bio-page!(<em>that's a joke LOL), but seriously though, thank you dearly!

            I've been on this coding journey for almost three years and man has it been an adventure! I started as a musician and decided in </em>2020</em> that I was going to make the transition into tech, considering it was another one of my passions. My first introduction to computer science was in 2010, when I majored in Networking. A special branch in the I.T field. From there I gained knowledge on how to develop basic websites and that's when I knew that this was something I had to get into eventually. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So fast-forward I just graduated my Data Science coding Bootcamp which deals with Data Analytics and Visualization.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently enrolled in another bootcamp for Full-Stack Develoment/ MERN stack and  I couldn't be any more happier. This is a true milestone for me.  Now my next goal is to find an employer who will take me in as one of their own, to be with a team of other ardently driven software engineers and together we can achieve many goals!
